# mayhem/build.sh — build the MazuCC fuzz target and the functional oracle.
#
# MazuCC is a minimalist single-binary C compiler: `mzcc <file.c>` reads the source (via stdin)
# and emits x86-64 AT&T assembly. We build it two ways from the upstream sources:
#   build/mzcc         sanitized + libFuzzer  -> the Mayhem target (in-process harness over the
#                                                SAME read_toplevels+emit code path as the CLI)
#   build-oracle/mzcc  normal flags           -> the mayhem/test.sh functional oracle (real CLI)
# The archived original fuzzed the raw `mzcc file.c` CLI, but a plain sanitizer CLI records 0 edges
# in Mayhem (no coverage tracer for "compatible analysis" — SPEC.md item 11), so the fuzz target is
# now an in-process libFuzzer harness (mayhem/mzcc/fuzz_mzcc.c) driving the identical parse+codegen
# path. Everything comes from the upstream .c files; no network, no upstream edits.

# -std=gnu99 matches upstream's Makefile. We drop upstream's -Wall -Werror (those keep upstream
# CI honest; clang-19 flags benign warnings in this code as errors) and its -no-pie (needed only
# to LINK mzcc's GENERATED programs, not to run the compiler itself — and ASan prefers PIE).

# Overlay-only: disables LeakSanitizer for the leaky compiler (a batch tool that never frees its
# AST/type allocations), linked into the sanitized target ONLY. Without it LSan reports a "leak" on
# every input in Mayhem → the fuzzer can't explore (host ASAN_OPTIONS is NOT honored by Mayhem's
# runtime, so it must be compiled in). The clean oracle never sees it.

# 1) Sanitized libFuzzer target — the compiler ITSELF is instrumented so ASan/UBSan see bugs inside
#    lexer/parser/codegen, and libFuzzer supplies edge coverage (SanitizerCoverage) so Mayhem gets
#    real feedback. The harness drives read_toplevels()+emit over the fuzz input (see fuzz_mzcc.c).
#    -Wl,--wrap=exit lets the harness survive mzcc's exit()-on-parse-error. -O1 keeps frames
#    readable for triage; $DEBUG_FLAGS after the sanitizer flags so -gdwarf-3 wins (DWARF < 4).

# 2) Clean oracle build (NO sanitizers) so mayhem/test.sh is an honest functional oracle that won't
#    false-fail on benign UB. $COVERAGE_FLAGS is empty by default (a coverage build appends it here).
